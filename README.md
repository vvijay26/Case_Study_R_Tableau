#### Objective
The objective of this case study is to analyze funding data of startups from crunchbase.com using R, Tableau and Excel and come up with an investment strategy for a hypothetical Asset management company. The main constraints of the investment company are -
1.	It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2.	It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in. English speaking means English is one of the official languages in that country
3. It wants to invest where other companies are investing. This pattern is often observed among startup investors.
